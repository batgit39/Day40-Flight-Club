# Day40-Flight-Club
The idea is to make a simple club which anyone can join with their email and username. Once they do so they should get the updates on the cheapest flights (yesterday's project)

Note- this project is not complete at the moment and will give errors, sadly I have reached the limit in one of the api's of this month so I can't troubleshoot anymore. But as soon as my limit refreshed I will complete this project. 
Error - It's not a very big issue but on certain flights when the number of stop overs is more than 1, is not fetched and used properly.
